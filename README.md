# R3TrainingMilestone1

This training module was completed on November 23rd. It consists of a Python program that uses Pygame to generate a maze on a grid with user specifed dimensions.
Once ran, the program first prompts the user to enter the size of the grid to generate the maze on, as shown below:

After the user inputs the dimension, the program generates the maze using a Binary Tree algorithm that has a southeast bias. Here is an example of a 5x5 maze generated by the program:
