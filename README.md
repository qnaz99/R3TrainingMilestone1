# R3TrainingMilestone1

This training module was completed on November 23rd. It consists of a Python program that uses Pygame to generate a maze on a grid with user specifed dimensions.
Once ran, the program first prompts the user to enter the size of the grid to generate the maze on, as shown below:

After the user inputs the dimension, the program generates the maze using a Binary Tree algorithm that has a southeast bias. Here is an example of a 5x5 maze generated by the program:

Here is a 20x20 maze that was also generated using the program:

# R3TrainingMilestone2

Milestone 2 was completed on December 1st. It takes the solution code for milestone 1 that was provided to us and converts the solution array into strings that indicate which direction the robot should move. For example: 

"[0][255][255][0]" would indicate a right turn;
"[255][0][0][255]" would indicate a left turn; and
"[0][255][0][255]" would indicate moving forward

These strings are then transfered to a remote client (presumably a robot) via TCP.
The code to parse the solution array and transmit the strings is appended to the maze.py file provided. The code to receive the strings is in receive.py. 

Here is a screenshot of the receive.py program running in Windows Powershell while the maze.py program transmits the strings:
